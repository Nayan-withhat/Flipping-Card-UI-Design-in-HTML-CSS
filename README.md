├── README.md
├── card.html
├── chip.png
├── logo.png

```

## Usage Examples

1.  **Basic Card Implementation:**

    The `card.html` file contains a basic implementation of the flipping card. You can modify the content within the front-face and back-face divs to customize the information displayed.

    ```html
    <div class="card front-face">
        <header>
            <span class="logo">
                <img src="logo.png" alt="">
                <h5>Master Card</h5>
            </span>
            <img src="chip.png" alt="" class="chip">
        </header>

        <div class="card-details">
           ...
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card back-face">
        ...
    </div>
    ```

2.  **Customizing the Card:**

    Modify the `style.css` file to change the colors, fonts, sizes, and overall appearance of the card.  You can also replace the `logo.png` and `chip.png` with your own images.

## Configuration Options

While this card uses pure HTML and CSS, you can customize the styling through the `style.css` file.  Key areas for customization include:

*   **Colors:** Modify background colors, text colors, and border colors.
*   **Fonts:** Change the font family, size, and weight of the text.
*   **Sizes:** Adjust the width, height, and padding of the card and its elements.
*   **Images:** Replace the `logo.png` and `chip.png` files with your own images.
